This is Octopi, a powerful Pacman/AUR frontend using Qt libs. 
================================================================

The project's source code is hosted at 
	https://github.com/aarnt/octopi.

You'll need a privilege escalation tool to use it, once running as 
root will ONLY work in KDE. Octopi supports kdesu and gksu for that.

For AUR support, "yaourt" is supported.
When you are in Chakra, "ccr" is supported.
While in KaOS, "kcp" is supported.

Enjoy!
